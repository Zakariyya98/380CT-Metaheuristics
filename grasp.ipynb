    "The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-studied optimization problem that has been proved to be non-deterministic NP hard problem (Mersiovsky et al., 2018). The TSP problem involves a travelling salesperson wanting to visit exactly one city in a list of cities and afterwards return to first city at the lowest cost. Metaheuristics algorithms such as Tabu search and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) can provide an optimized way to solve this problem. \n",

    "GRASP is a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems, introduced by Feo and Resende (Anh Tu, Tuan Dat, Quang Dung, 2018). It is also recognized as a single solution-based metaheuristic which improves a single solution. This can be considered as a “walk” through neighborhoods through the search space of the problem at hand, in this case TSP problem (Talbi, 2009).\n",

    "During the construction phase a set of candidate solutions are generated from a current solution. The set of candidates are generated by a local search. Then comes the replacement phase which focuses on selecting a candidate solution from the set of candidates and replaces the current solution. The replacement phase is iterated multiple times until a certain criterion is achieved (Ribeiro, Resende, 199). \n",

    "The neighborhood is a key part of designing a solution-based algorithm. The structure of the neighborhood can have an effect on the performance of the algorithm being implemented.
