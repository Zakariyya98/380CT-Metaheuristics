NOTE TO MARKER:

The Notebook file we are submitting is '380CT Grasp and Ant Colony Portfolio.ipynb' we have discovered a slight issue with some parts of the notebook not being displayed in the GitHub Viewer, however, if this is the case during marking downloading the notebook will display all the work we have contributed to this assessment. (Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Python is required)
